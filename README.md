# Pomodoro-timer.v2
A version of pomodoro timer inspired by Forest app, developed on pure JavaScript.

## Functions
Rather than just a regular timer, this timer has the following functions:
* Background sounds that can be played either alone or simultaneously, with the option of controlling their volume;
* Keeping track of the 'pomodores' i.e. the number of focus cycles completed, in the figure of planted tomatoes;
* Default focus time is set to 25 minutes, but this can be changed by the user and the system registers this information for further cycles;
* After a focus cycle, the application automatically sets to 5min, which is the indicated time between pomodores, according to the Pomodore Technique;
* After four pomodores, the application autommatically sets a rest time of 30 minutes. This is also a part of the Pomodoro Technique.
